# first_CSS_portfolio

## Description

For homework #2, I created a website for my full-stack developer portfolio. My motivation was to build my website closely to the example webpage to demonstrate my abilities to utilize CSS. Some short-comings that I learned and discovered this week are as follow:
- It would be better in the future to completely write out what it is I was looking for, rather than go straight into constructing the HTML. Taking the time to appropriately plan the website would make breaking up the CSS much easier AND searching what CSS issues I was having much easier.
- One of the major things I learned was building the HTML and deciding what tags should have their own classes versus being grouped together/having the same classes and finding out how CSS responded to that sectioning.
- I was having lots of issues understanding page responsiveness. After working with my fellow classmates (their names will be added in the Credits section), I came to realize that a lot of responsiveness came from a good flex box base, only then would media queries work more easily.
- Another thing I found from a website I used as supplemental material is that it is best to design the website for mobile devices earlier. The consensus is that it is easier to work smaller and then increase the viewpoint such that editing/adding things is easier.
- I also learned from Nicholas and Allan other ways to include images for the "Work" or "Projects" portion of the portfolio. We spoke about using grids and how implementing them would take more time, but it would have made the page respond better.
- Last point: This is a very unresponsive page. I realized quite quickly to the end how poorly planned this project was and I wanted to at least complete this by the deadline to show that I can do something in CSS. If I had been more cognizant of what I needed to focus on I believe this page would have been better. I am submitting this in hopes I can resubmit this to learn from these mistakes I made this time and learn to make a more responsive page by the time I resubmit!
